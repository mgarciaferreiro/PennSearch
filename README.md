# PennSearch (NETS 150 Final Project)

### Configuration
This project requires several dependencies to run. These are imported directly from Jar packages. So, before running the program, make sure that all the Jar files are loaded into VScode. To see this, click on the tab called Java Dependencies in the left bottom panel to expand it. Click on Referenced Libraries to expand it and you should see `bson-3.4.3.jar`, `jsoup-1.13.1.jar`, `mongodb-driver-3.4.3.jar`, and `mongodb-driver-core-3.4.3.jar`. If any package is not there, hover on Referenced Libraries and you should see a **+** sign. Click the plus sign and change the directory to the `lib` folder. Add the misssing packages from there.
