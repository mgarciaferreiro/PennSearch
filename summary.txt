Implementation

Description:
Penn Search is a small search engine with a Javascript frontend for visualizing the results and a Java 
backend that crawls Penn-related websites and allows the user to perform queries within those.
Starting at https://www.upenn.edu/, we find all the external links in the html and follow 
them and repeat this step for some time. We store all this crawled website content in a Mongo database 
and allow the user to perform queries. Page Rank and the tf-idf vector for each page is calculated once 
after getting all the website contents, so each query after that is relatively fast. The search results 
are ranked by a score of page rank * cosine similarity between page and query, so both page authoritativeness 
and relevance to query are taken into account.

Relevant Topics: 
This project is related to the topics covered in class of Information Networks (World Wide Web), 
Document Search, and Graph Algorithms (BFS for web crawling and Page Rank).

Work breakdown:
Peter: crawling websites, storing website content on the database, Javascript UI, and integrating the Java 
backend with Javascript frontend.
Marta: reading contents from database, search, and ranking (modifying the vector space model from HW4 
and implementing Page Rank).
